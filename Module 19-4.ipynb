    "The easiest coefficient to interpret is -223.57, which says that family making a given income with kids will spend $223.57 less per year than another family making the same income without kids. The constant 873 is tougher to interpret, but could be seen as a baseline or minimum, since that is the expenditure our model would predict if a family had no kids and no income. However, it is likely that this is a rare condition that the model is better fit for predicting expenditures of families with incomes. As such, the constant is best interpreted as the bias of the model. Finally, the coefficients of 0.0012 and 0.00002 for annual income and the square of annual income are very difficult to interpret. If the squared term were not included then the 0.0012 term would be simple enough to interpret, but with the squared term present the best interpretation is to say that expenditure increases as income increases.<br> <br>\n",
    "In order to ensure that the interpretations of the model make sense statistically, it would be good to have t-test and p-value statistics for each coefficient."

    "The P-values of all coefficients are zero, so they are each statistically significant. I would have expected humidity to be inversely correlated with my temp_diff variable as it is computed (actual temp - apparent temp), because this has been my general observation. However, I live in Texas, which is much hotter than Szeged, which helps explain why humidity is positively correlated with temp_diff. Humidity does not always make the temperature feel hotter than it actually is, but rather it tends to make hot feel hotter and cold feel colder. Thus, with Szeged being a cold place, this positive correlation makes sense to me."
