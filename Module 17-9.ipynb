    "There are numerous physical variables that affect a physical coin toss, and they could be used in a simulated model of the toss. However, if I were to model the toss of a fair coin, I would simply rely on random number generation and assign even and odd to heads and tails. This is much simpler than trying to model the physics of the toss and will yield substantially the same results."
